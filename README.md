# PeteMP3
**the worst mp3 player in the history of mp3 players**
<br />
PeteMP3 is a very basic mp3 player i made using _tkinter_ and _pygame_, its pretty much bad on purpose.
i basically made it to test out my tkinter'ing skills.

it doesnt have much features, other than having peter griffin dance to your music.

> dont worry, he doesnt judge your music taste ðŸ¤£

i plan on improving and adding stuff to this little project, i hope you enjoy this.<br />
(also, feel free to contribute :D )
